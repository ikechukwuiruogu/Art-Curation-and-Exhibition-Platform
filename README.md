# ArtDAO: Decentralized Art Curation and Exhibition Platform

## Project Vision

ArtDAO is a revolutionary blockchain-powered platform that democratizes art curation, exhibition, and monetization. By leveraging blockchain technology, we create a transparent, community-driven ecosystem that empowers artists, curators, and art enthusiasts to collaborate, exhibit, and trade digital and physical artworks.

## Core Innovation

Traditional art world challenges:
- Centralized curation
- High barriers to entry
- Limited artist compensation
- Opaque revenue models

ArtDAO solves these problems through decentralized governance, transparent royalty mechanisms, and community-driven exhibition design.

## Key Features

### 1. NFT Artwork Representation
- Each artwork tokenized as a unique NFT
- Immutable provenance and ownership records
- Automated royalty tracking and distribution
- Supports multiple art formats (digital, physical, mixed media)

### 2. Community Governance
- Decentralized voting mechanisms for:
    - Exhibition theme selection
    - Artwork curation
    - Platform feature development
- Quadratic voting to prevent whale dominance
- Transparent proposal and voting processes

### 3. Virtual Exhibition Infrastructure
- 3D and VR-compatible exhibition spaces
- Tokenized access passes
- Dynamic, community-curated galleries
- Global accessibility

### 4. Advanced Monetization Model
- Transparent revenue sharing
- Automatic royalty splits between:
    - Artists
    - Curators
    - Platform maintainers
- Micro-transaction support
- Flexible commission structures
